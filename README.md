Good-day gentlemen & gentry,

You are very much welcome, I would love to make each one of your acquaintance. It would be difficult however, as there are many limitations to friendship in this time-space continuum (whatever that means). I also wish to humor you all with a few jokes and provide some laughs, alas I am not your typical funny type with the quick witted humor. I am more of a deliberate thinker than a court jester. These are the cards we are all dealt.
